Benchmark report can be found

N.B. The benchmark report linked above was obtained from gitlab free runners, so benchmarking conditions are not ideal.
Take that report with a large grain of salt.
It is recommended to run the benchmarks locally and in *quite* conditions to obtain more meaningful benchmarks.
